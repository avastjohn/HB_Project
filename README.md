###How It Works

Drag and drop arrows into the codeboxes to help your pet reach their treat. Loop arrow makes all previous code repeat. Yellow and Blue tabs are for if statements (ex: if on a yellow square, go right) - this feature coming soon.

###About Me

My educational background is in Developmental Psychology, Math, and Education. I love teaching, mentoring, and sharing my knowledge with anyone who can use it. 

I am a full stack software developer currently seeking my next opportunity. I genuinely enjoy both front end and back end development, and I am open to trying just about anything as long as I am working with a great team!
